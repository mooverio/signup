					We are working hard to build the worlds first true omnichannel delivery service. 
					We are building an entire ecosystem and platform to support peer to peer, 
					business to consumer and business to business delivery. <br>
					We are looking for partners that share the same vision of changing deliveries for ever. <br>
					<br>
					We are taking all the hassle out of shipping your product for your business so you 
					can focus on what you do best. Our proven Delivery as a Service concept means 
					that you can provide Same Day Delivery for all local customers in a way that scales globally.<br>
					<br>
					Partners of Moover can connect to our common API framework to provide a shipping 
					option that has been unheard of until now. We can deliver to your customers 
					where they are, not what their dress is. The world does not revolve around adresses - 
					the world revolves around people. We deliver to the people. <br>
					<br>
					The API is soon available to many tech platforms such as WordPress, 
					WooCommerce, Magento, Episerver and more. We also support bespoke solutions, 
					with a resilient and well defined API.

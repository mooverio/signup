				<h1>We are starting on a big journey. Or a million small ones.</h1>
				<p>We, the happy people at Moover are changing deliveries for ever. We want to bring affordable same day shipping for everyone, whether it is from you to your friends, your loved ones or from your business to another. We moove it anyway. Crazy cheap, for everyone, for ever.</p>
				<p>Changing shipping and deliveries for ever is a big idea. Ambitious, but not impossible. We are not doing it alone, we have you. The first Moovers. You are the special ones. Changing the world. We are only the catalyst.</p>

				<h2>Introducing DaaS</h2>
				<p>The world is full of concepts, and we are introducing our own. DaaS, or Delivery as a Service is exactly what Moover is all about. It takes the effort and risks out of local deliveries and shipping.</p>
				<p>Our service picks up your stuff where you are - or where you aren’t, and deliver it to where you are or where you aren’t.</p>
